## 🎉 About the App

Git Tipsy++ is not just your ordinary event planning app; it's a full-stack React application that we lovingly crafted from scratch, fueled by the enthusiasm and passion for coding! Together, Victoria Platt, Sam Baldwin, and Tom Webb embarked on this exciting journey to bring our fellow bootcampers together for a memorable hackathon and celebration in Reading. 🚀

## 🎉 Let's Code the Perfect Celebration Together!

At Git Tipsy++, we believe in doing things the fun and challenging way! Sure, we could have easily used a Google Form for RSVPs, but where's the adventure in that? We've taken this opportunity to showcase our skills, collaboration, and love for coding by building this full-stack React app with a delightful touch of Material UI for some added flair! 🎨

From Figma Jam Boards for planning to a Trello board for tracking tasks, we've embraced Agile and Scrum to ensure we deliver a top-notch app for you! 💻
