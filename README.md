## 🎉 About the App

Git Tipsy++ is not just your ordinary event planning app; it's a full-stack React application that we lovingly crafted from scratch, fueled by the enthusiasm and passion for coding! Together, [Your Name], [Sam Baldwin], and [Tom Webb] embarked on this exciting journey to bring our fellow bootcampers together for a memorable hackathon and celebration in Reading. 🚀

## 🎉 Let's Code the Perfect Celebration Together!

At Git Tipsy++, we believe in doing things the fun and challenging way! Sure, we could have easily used a Google Form for RSVPs, but where's the adventure in that? We've taken this opportunity to showcase our skills, collaboration, and love for coding by building this full-stack React app with a delightful touch of Material UI for some added flair! 🎨

From Figma Jam Boards for planning to a Trello board for tracking tasks, we've embraced Agile and Scrum to ensure we deliver a top-notch app for you! 💻
